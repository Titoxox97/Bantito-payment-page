# HW1-CodeRefactor-MA

Implementing the use of semantics and CSS into an already existing website to refactor the code.

# Resources

I used google and w3schools to get a better understanding of semantics and from there replaced all the div classes in the index.html document to more specific semantic elements such as "section" and "content". I also utilized the resources of my tutor to work on and better understand the assignment.

# Actions

I reorganized the structure of the HTML elements in order to better specify between sections. I also added alt elements to the images on the website page to add a description should the image not load.
